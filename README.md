# EchoBot

### What it is
The EchoBot is a tiny EchoBot that repeats anything you say to it.

Languages used are Front-end: JavasScript, Back-end: PHP.

The project is deployed at: https://rafahalani.github.io/EchoBot/  but the end user should start the server locally as mentioned in the API section below.

### How to use 

The end user inputs a message into the EchoBot input field. The end user can submit their input by way of the send button or by pressing the enter key.

Then the EchoBot responds with the same message in a new reply.


### API 

The API project server is started by typing in this command `php -S 0.0.0.0:8080` in the terminal. The end user can then navigate to http://localhost:8080/ on their machine and use the EchoBot as intended.
